GitHub is the default version control system used at the city. We use an [http://github.austintexas.gov](on-premise installation of the Enterprise version), as well as the main GitHub.com service under [https://github.com/cityofaustin](the "cityofaustin" organization).

In this guide you'll find instructions on how to set up your account(s) and how to incorporate GitHub best practices into your development flow.
