Travis offers 2 solutions:

- A free version at [travis-ci.org](http://travis-ci.org), which is great for use with public repositories hosted at github.com, and
- A paid version at [travis-ci.com](http://travis-ci.com), which is meant for use with private repositories.

At the moment the city does not have an account on the paid version so this document will focus on the free version.

## Account setup

Travis uses the GitHub api for account management and credentialing. Simply sign in using GitHub and Travis will be able to read all of the public repos you're a contributor on whether they're on your personal account or part of the cityofaustin organization.
