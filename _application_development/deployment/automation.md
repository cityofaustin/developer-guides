Automated deployment, more accurately referred to as _continuous deployment_, allows developers to create seamless syncing between their repository branches and all of their deployment environments. This ensures that the deployed code is reflective of what any other developer can access in the repo, eliminating the potential for confusion and reducing the potential for human error to mess up a deployment.

There are a number of tools that CoA developers can use to employ continuous deployment in their applications. Read more about them below
