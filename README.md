# Developer Guides

:construction: This is a work in progress

This repo contains extensive documentation around workflows, best practices, tools, and architectural considerations for web developers at the City of Austin.

The site uses the [Zilker Jekyll theme](https://github.com/cityofaustin/zilker-theme) for UI and navigation handling. Future changes might be required to frontmatter and `_config.yml` based on future iterations. Zilker is currently undergoing structural changes to nav, layouts, and CSS.
